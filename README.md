Why we are here and what we plan to do...

We want to help the NI economy be innovative with free open data at its core. As a society of 1.8m people we are using more and more applications that record our data everyday and by making sure that data is anonymised and free at point of entry could help build better services for us.

Feel free to add datasets (preferable in json or xml and csv) in the data sources folder.

If you've an app suggestion feel free to push up or commit to the repos here! (Happy coding)

Finally if you'd like to contact us do so @ opendataniforum@gmail.com

Ta!
